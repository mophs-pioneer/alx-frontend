WHAT IS RESPONSIVE DESIGN?
The term responsive web design, first coined by Ethan Marcote in 2010, describes a technique in which a website’s design is automatically adjusted based on the size of users’ screens. Thanks to responsive design, users can easily browse a website regardless of what device they use.

The site’s layout and content will change based on the width of a browser on a device. Quick tip: You can determine whether or not a website is responsive by manually zooming in and out of the browser window.

Responsive design means that you only need one website. The design, content, and user interface of your website is adapted so that visitors can seamlessly visit it on any device and any browser.

You no longer have to create two versions of a website—one for desktop computers and one for mobile devices. You can always tell if a website has been designed for mobile devices with the URL that starts with a “m,” such as m.facebook.com.

WHAT IS AN ADAPTIVE WEBSITE?
When a website features a responsive design, it means it will adapt to the width of users’ screens, allowing for maximum versatility. If a website is adaptive, it will adapt to specific screen widths of desktop computers, tablets or smartphones.

Devices all have set browser widths that are widely known and enable developers to develop websites that will adhere to their specifications.

Creating an entirely responsive website takes time because it must optimally adapt to the width of every browser. Note that the terms “responsive” and “adaptive” are often confusingly interchanged; oftentimes, developers create websites that are both responsive and adaptive.

However, several websites may seem responsive—but are not; they may actually be a blend of both techniques.

WHAT IS MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN?
When you first create or re-create your website, you don’t have to choose between a mobile-first or responsive design. Instead, the former is actually a design strategy (mobile-first), while the latter is the result of a technical approach (responsive).

If a business develops its website, the design is often based on the assumption that visitors will browse it on a desktop computer. Then, the website is modified to adapt to different devices, including smartphones and tablets. In other words, the site is scaled down; this approach is widely known as graceful degradation or desktop-first.

Unfortunately, many visual aspects and features of a website are optimized for desktop computers—but adapt poorly to mobile devices. This is when designers adapt a new approach called progressive enhancement or a mobile-first strategy.

By doing so, they initially design a website for the smallest mobile devices possible and then scale upwards to adapt to desktop computers.

Initially introduced in 2009 by Luke Wroblewski, the mobile-first concept purports that the mobile version of a website should be at the heart of the design strategy and take into account the constraints and user browsing behaviour on mobile devices.

Because adopting a mobile-first strategy is quite different from a desktop development approach, it can be challenging for teams who are used to designing for browsing on computers. When you embark on a mobile-first strategy, your website’s content must be carefully analyzed and structured to categorize it based on importance and ensure that the overall design remains refined.

Additional layers of content can then be added for visitors who browse using larger screens.
